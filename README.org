* Matrix-Bot

This is a bot I made for me and my friends' [[https://matrix.to/#/!ShuXi5ohrPUtKHkrNO:matrix.nullring.xyz?via=matrix.nullring.xyz&via=matrix.org&via=rm-r.org][Matrix community]]. It's made in
Common Lisp because that is my currently favourite language, even if I am not
the best at it yet. This bot also includes a thin matrix API library which is
NOT ready for production use but which I might make available as a separate ASDF
system later on as it matures and maybe put it on the Quicklisp dist.
